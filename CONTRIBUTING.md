# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! To ensure the quality and ethical use of the project, please review and follow these guidelines before submitting your contribution.

## What We Accept

We prioritize contributions that **significantly improve the functionality** or **add new features** to the project. Examples of acceptable contributions include:

- Adding new functionality that enhances the performance or capabilities of the application.
- Improving the efficiency of the codebase (e.g., by optimizing algorithms or reducing resource usage).
- Extending support for new platforms, environments, or use cases.
- Bug fixes that resolve issues affecting the functionality of the application.
- Documentation updates, **but only if** they are directly related to new features or significant changes in the application’s functionality by the code you added.

## What We Do Not Accept

We do not accept contributions that:

- Make superficial changes, such as modifying a color scheme, replacing a comment, or minor layout tweaks.
- Focus solely on updating documentation (e.g., README.md) without accompanying code changes that introduce new features or improve functionality.
- Remove code blocks marked as essential for ensuring ethical and transparent use of AI technologies, particularly in cases where AI-generated content is involved.

## Ethical Use of AI in the Project

This project incorporates AI for advanced features, such as face replacement and voice cloning. As such, it’s important to ensure that all contributions adhere to strict ethical standards:

- Contributions must comply with the project’s [Acceptable Use Policy](https://wunjo.online/acceptable-use-policy), which outlines the proper and transparent use of AI technologies.
- **Do not remove or alter any code marked to indicate that content is AI-generated** (e.g., invisible markers or comments indicating synthetic content). These markers ensure transparency and accountability when AI is used.
- All contributions should respect the privacy, rights, and dignity of individuals. Do not contribute code that could be used to violate these principles.

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create your feature branch.
   - `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards of the project.
3. Ensure all existing tests pass, and create new tests for your changes where applicable.
4. **Commit your changes** with clear and descriptive commit messages.
   - `git commit -m "Add feature XYZ"`
5. **Push to your fork** and submit a Pull Request (PR) to the main repository.

Please make sure that your PR includes:
- A detailed explanation of what your changes add or improve.
- A note on how the changes were tested.
- If applicable, include any ethical considerations or impacts of your changes on the use of AI within the project.
