<!-- WUNJO V2 -->
## Big update Wunjo v2.0.3

### Video generation here!

<b>Hey there!</b> Your support means the world to me and is crucial in accelerating the release of new updates for the Community Edition (CE). Your encouragement and stars drives me to enhance features. And now <b>video generation</b> from text or image in CE with difference aspect ratio before 4 seconds with 24 FPS (or more duration with low FPS).

Also text to image, inpaint and outpaint image for video generation. <b>Control restyling?</b> Now you can change objects, gender and nationality of a person not just in one click, but also control the process in advance. And you only need 8 GB VRAM for this. (You can use any Stable Diffusion model v1.5, see GitHub Wiki)

### Available now

<b>Professional (Pro) version</b> available on <a href="https://wunjo.online">wunjo.online</a> to download. <b>Community Edition (CE)</b> available on GitHub with voting for features to migrate on <a href="https://boosty.to/wunjo">Boosty</a>.

<b>And if you wanna help to project, you can do:</b> 
<ul>
  <li>Spread the Word: Share the project with your friends and invite them to join our community.</li>
  <li>Stay Connected: Subscribe to the Wunjo project on GitHub and follow me on social media. You can find me by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@wladradchenko">wladradchenko</a> in social media and <a href="https://t.me/wladblog">wladblog</a> in Telegram.</li>

<!-- PREMISE -->
## Premise

Wunjo comes from the ancient runic alphabet and represents joy and contentment, which could tie into the idea of using the application to create engaging and expressive speech. Vunyo (ᚹ) is the eighth rune of the Elder and Anglo-Saxon Futhark. Prior to the introduction of the letter W into the Latin alphabet, the letter Ƿynn (Ƿƿ) was used instead in English, derived from this rune.

<!-- CREDITS -->
## Credits

Wunjo is built upon the remarkable work of various open-source projects. Each integrated component reflects a commitment to improving and adapting existing technologies within the collaborative landscape of open-source development. The list below highlights the projects that have been adapted and enhanced for inclusion in Wunjo:

- **User Interface & Packaging:** Implementations of [Flask UI](https://github.com/ClimenteA/flaskwebgui) and [BeeWare](https://beeware.org/project/projects/tools/briefcase/)
- **Facial Animation & Enhancement:** Adapted versions of [Wav2lip](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip), [Face Utils](https://github.com/xinntao/facexlib), [Insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) which provided a well-made library and some models for face.
- **Image & Video Enhancement:** Adapted [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) for superior quality enhancements
- **Video Processing & Segmentation:** Adaptations of [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything), [Rerender a Video](https://github.com/williamyang1991/Rerender_A_Video), [GMFlow](https://github.com/haofeixu/gmflow), [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet) and upgraded [Ebsynth](https://github.com/jamriska/ebsynth)
- **Video and Image Generation:** [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) and [Stable Video Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt) for creative image and video AI-driven art.

I extend my deepest gratitude to the original contributors of these technologies. Their groundbreaking work has been instrumental in advancing the capabilities of Wunjo CE. For the persistent storage and versioning of the models I have personally trained, I utilize the [Hugging Face Model Storage](https://huggingface.co/wladradchenko/wunjo.wladradchenko.ru). If you're interested in contributing to Wunjo CE, especially in the area of voice cloning for new languages, please feel free to propose your models or reach out for collaboration via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wladradchenko/wunjo.wladradchenko.ru/discussions) or the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/wladradchenko/wunjo.wladradchenko.ru/discussions).
