# Security Policy

This project is open source, and I encourage contributions from the community to maintain its security. If you discover a vulnerability or have concerns about the security of the application, please follow these guidelines:

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- If you find a security vulnerability, please report it by creating a discussion in the **"Security"** topic in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wladradchenko/wunjo.wladradchenko.ru/discussions/74). This will allow for open communication and transparency with the community.
  
- When reporting, please provide as much detail as possible, including:
  - Affected versions of the application.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue.
  - Potential impact of the vulnerability.

## Security Updates

- Security updates will only be supported in the latest version of the `main` branch. I encourage all users to keep their local versions up to date to benefit from the latest security enhancements.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure!
